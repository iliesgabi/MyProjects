  Project description

  With this project you can check and generate Hamming codes. You just need to write them down in a file named "fisier.txt" and it
will be shown a question. Press 1 to generate the code and press 2 to check the code. The result will be shown in the console and 
in a file. 

  I developed this project in Assembly.
